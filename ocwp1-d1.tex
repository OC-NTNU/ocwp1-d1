\abstract{
This deliverable surveys the state-of-the art in literature-based knowledge discovery.
This includes a survey of key publications, approaches, software and resources related to literature-based knowledge discovery in general as well any work specifically in the area of climate, marine and environmental science. 
The purpose is to (1) prevent duplication of efforts, (2) to promote reuse of existing theory, practice and resources, (3) to identify potential bottlenecks early on and (4) to generally make sure that the results from work on WP1 will reach or exceed the state-of-the-art in the field.
Chapter 1 surveys text mining in general as a combination of information retrieval, information extraction, natural language processing and data mining.
The remainder of the chapter is focused on text mining in biomedicine, as almost all work on literature mining originates from this area.
A couple of text mining applications are described, followed by a description of the major tasks in text mining, i.e. entity detection, relation and event extraction.
The closely related fields of machine reading and open information extraction are Briefly discussed.
Chapter 2 provides an in depth survey of literature-based knowledge discovery.
Approaches are grouped into domain-independent, concept-based and relation extraction-based -- ranging from purely statistical methods to those involving sophisticated natural language processing.
The largely unresolved issue of system evaluation is reviewed.
Chapter 4 survey work on text mining in the domain of climate, marine and environmental science.
Efforts specifically in this area turn out to be few and far between, so tools, resources and applications in related areas are taken into consideration here, for example, from ecology, geology and paleobiology.
%Finally, chapter 5 discusses some ongoing and planned work in WP1 as far as related to the content of this deliverable.
