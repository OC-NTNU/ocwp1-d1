Excitation is a semantic property of predicates that classifies them into excitatory, inhibitory and neutral. We show that Excitation is useful for extracting contradiction pairs (e.g., destroy cancer \&bottom; develop cancer) and causality pairs (e.g., increase in crime ⇒ heighten anxiety). Our experiments show that with automatically acquired Excitation knowledge we can extract one million contradiction pairs and 500,000 causality pairs with about 70\% precision from a 600 million page Web corpus. Furthermore, by combining these extracted causality and contradiction pairs, we can generate one million plausible causality hypotheses that are not written in any single sentence in our corpus with reasonable precision.},

@article{Mihaila2013BioCause,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Biomedical corpora annotated with event-level information represent an important resource for domain-specific information extraction ({IE}) systems. However, bio-event annotation alone cannot cater for all the needs of biologists. Unlike work on relation and event extraction, most of which focusses on specific events and named entities, we aim to build a comprehensive resource, covering all statements of causal association present in discourse. Causality lies at the heart of biomedical knowledge, such as diagnosis, pathology or systems biology, and, thus, automatic causality recognition can greatly reduce the human workload by suggesting possible causal connections and aiding in the curation of pathway models. A biomedical text corpus annotated with such relations is, hence, crucial for developing and evaluating biomedical text {mining.RESULTS}:We have defined an annotation scheme for enriching biomedical domain corpora with causality relations. This schema has subsequently been used to annotate 851 causal relations to form {BioCause}, a collection of 19 open-access full-text biomedical journal articles belonging to the subdomain of infectious diseases. These documents have been pre-annotated with named entity and event information in the context of previous shared tasks. We report an inter-annotator agreement rate of over 60\% for triggers and of over 80\% for arguments using an exact match constraint. These increase significantly using a relaxed match setting. Moreover, we analyse and describe the causality relations in {BioCause} from various points of view. This information can then be leveraged for the training of automatic causality detection {systems.CONCLUSION}:Augmenting named entity and event annotations with information about causal discourse relations could benefit the development of more sophisticated {IE} systems. These will further influence the development of multiple tasks, such as enabling textual inference to detect entailments, discovering new facts and providing new hypotheses for experimental work.},

Information retrieval, although essential for assembling such fragments, is always problematic. The search process, like a scientific theory, can be criticized and improved, but can never be verified as capable of retrieving all information relevant to a problem or theory. This essential incompleteness of search and retrieval therefore makes possible, and plausible, the existence of undiscovered public knowledge. Three examples intended to throw light on the logic of undiscovered knowledge are constructed and analyzed. The argument is developed within the framework of a Popperian or critical approach within science and on Popper's distinction between subjective and objective knowledge--the distinction between World 2 and World 3.},

Making such relationships explicit supports hypothesis generation and discovery. Currently LBD systems depend exclusively on co-occurrence of words or concepts in target documents, regardless of whether relations actually exist between the words or concepts. We describe a method to enhance LBD through capture of semantic relations from the literature via use of natural language processing (NLP). This paper reports on an application of LBD that combines two NLP systems: BioMedLEE and SemRep, which are coupled with an LBD system called BITOLA. The two NLP systems complement each other to increase the types of information utilized by BITOLA. We also discuss issues associated with combining heterogeneous systems. Initial experiments suggest this approach can uncover new associations that were not possible using previous methods.}},

    abstract = {
                Manually annotated corpora are critical for the training and evaluation of automated methods to identify concepts in biomedical text.
                This paper presents the concept annotations of the Colorado Richly Annotated {Full-Text} ({CRAFT}) Corpus, a collection of 97 full-length, open-access biomedical journal articles that have been annotated both semantically and syntactically to serve as a research resource for the biomedical natural-language-processing ({NLP}) community. {CRAFT} identifies all mentions of nearly all concepts from nine prominent biomedical ontologies and terminologies: the Cell Type Ontology, the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest ontology, the {NCBI} Taxonomy, the Protein Ontology, the Sequence Ontology, the entries of the Entrez Gene database, and the three subontologies of the Gene Ontology. The first public release includes the annotations for 67 of the 97 articles, reserving two sets of 15 articles for future text-mining competitions (after which these too will be released). Concept annotations were created based on a single set of guidelines, which has enabled us to achieve consistently high interannotator agreement.
                As the initial 67-article release contains more than 560,000 tokens (and the full set more than 790,000 tokens), our corpus is among the largest gold-standard annotated biomedical corpora. Unlike most others, the journal articles that comprise the corpus are drawn from diverse biomedical disciplines and are marked up in their entirety. Additionally, with a concept-annotation count of nearly 100,000 in the 67-article subset (and more than 140,000 in the full collection), the scale of conceptual markup is also among the largest of comparable corpora. The concept annotations of the {CRAFT} Corpus have the potential to significantly advance biomedical text mining by providing a high-quality gold standard for {NLP} systems. The corpus, annotation guidelines, and other associated resources are freely available at {http://bionlp-corpora.sourceforge.net/CRAFT}/index.shtml.

@article{Thompson2011Enriching,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Biomedical papers contain rich information about entities, facts and events of biological relevance. To discover these automatically, we use text mining techniques, which rely on annotated corpora for training. In order to extract protein-protein interactions, genotype-phenotype/gene-disease associations, etc., we rely on event corpora that are annotated with classified, structured representations of important facts and findings contained within text. These provide an important resource for the training of domain-specific information extraction ({IE}) systems, to facilitate semantic-based searching of documents. Correct interpretation of these events is not possible without additional information, e.g., does an event describe a fact, a hypothesis, an experimental result or an analysis of results? How confident is the author about the validity of her analyses? These and other types of information, which we collectively term meta-knowledge, can be derived from the context of the {event.RESULTS}:We have designed an annotation scheme for meta-knowledge enrichment of biomedical event corpora. The scheme is multi-dimensional, in that each event is annotated for 5 different aspects of meta-knowledge that can be derived from the textual context of the event. Textual clues used to determine the values are also annotated. The scheme is intended to be general enough to allow integration with different types of bio-event annotation, whilst being detailed enough to capture important subtleties in the nature of the meta-knowledge expressed in the text. We report here on both the main features of the annotation scheme, as well as its application to the {GENIA} event corpus (1000 abstracts with 36,858 events). High levels of inter-annotator agreement have been achieved, falling in the range of 0.84-0.93 {Kappa.CONCLUSION}:By augmenting event annotations with meta-knowledge, more sophisticated {IE} systems can be trained, which allow interpretative information to be specified as part of the search criteria. This can assist in a number of important tasks, e.g., finding new experimental knowledge to facilitate database curation, enabling textual inference to detect entailments and contradictions, etc. To our knowledge, our scheme is unique within the field with regards to the diversity of meta-knowledge aspects annotated for each event.},

    abstract = {We propose an approach to natural language inference based on a model of natural logic, which identifies valid inferences by their lexical and syntactic features, without full semantic interpretation. We greatly extend past work in natural logic, which has focused solely on semantic containment and monotonicity, to incorporate both semantic exclusion and implicativity. Our system decomposes an inference problem into a sequence of atomic edits linking premise to hypothesis; predicts a lexical entailment relation for each edit using a statistical classifier; propagates these relations upward through a syntax tree according to semantic properties of intermediate nodes; and composes the resulting entailment relations across the edit sequence. We evaluate our system on the {FraCaS} test suite, and achieve a 27\% reduction in error from previous work. We also show that hybridizing an existing {RTE} system with our natural logic system yields significant gains on the {RTE3} test suite.},

    abstract = {
                Identification of discourse relations, such as causal and contrastive relations, between situations mentioned in text is an important task for biomedical text-mining. A biomedical text corpus annotated with discourse relations would be very useful for developing and evaluating methods for biomedical discourse processing. However, little effort has been made to develop such an annotated resource.
                We have developed the Biomedical Discourse Relation Bank ({BioDRB}), in which we have annotated explicit and implicit discourse relations in 24 open-access full-text biomedical articles from the {GENIA} corpus. Guidelines for the annotation were adapted from the Penn Discourse {TreeBank} ({PDTB}), which has discourse relations annotated over open-domain news articles. We introduced new conventions and modifications to the sense classification. We report reliable inter-annotator agreement of over 80\% for all sub-tasks. Experiments for identifying the sense of explicit discourse connectives show the connective itself as a highly reliable indicator for coarse sense classification (accuracy 90.9\% and F1 score 0.89). These results are comparable to results obtained with the same classifier on the {PDTB} data. With more refined sense classification, there is degradation in performance (accuracy 69.2\% and F1 score 0.28), mainly due to sparsity in the data. The size of the corpus was found to be sufficient for identifying the sense of explicit connectives, with classifier performance stabilizing at about 1900 training instances. Finally, the classifier performs poorly when trained on {PDTB} and tested on {BioDRB} (accuracy 54.5\% and F1 score 0.57).
                Our work shows that discourse relations can be reliably annotated in biomedical text. Coarse sense disambiguation of explicit connectives can be done with high reliability by using just the connective as a feature, but more refined sense classification requires either richer features or more annotated data. The poor performance of a classifier trained in the open domain and tested in the biomedical domain suggests significant differences in the semantic usage of connectives across these domains, and provides robust evidence for a biomedical sublanguage for discourse and the need to develop a specialized biomedical discourse annotated corpus. The results of our cross-domain experiments are consistent with related work on identifying connectives in {BioDRB}.

    abstract = {Open Information Extraction ({IE}) is the task of extracting assertions from massive corpora without requiring a pre-specified vocabulary. This paper shows that the output of state-of-the-art Open {IE} systems is rife with uninformative and incoherent extractions. To overcome these problems, we introduce two simple syntactic and lexical constraints on binary relations expressed by verbs. We implemented the constraints in the {ReVerb} Open {IE} system, which more than doubles the area under the precision-recall curve relative to previous extractors such as {TextRunner} and woepos. More than 30\% of {ReVerb}'s extractions are at precision 0.8 or higher---compared to virtually none for earlier systems. The paper concludes with a detailed analysis of {ReVerb}'s errors, suggesting directions for future work.},

Due to this abundance scientists are often no longer capable of keeping up with publications in their specific areas of research, let alone finding, reading, and analyzing potentially related scientific publications. Real advances in research, however, can be achieved only if a researcher can obtain an overview of the state of a given research question in a timely manner. This chapter presents methods to help researchers access the content of the biomedical literature. Information Retrieval (IR) identifies, in a large document database, the documents that are most relevant to a search topic provided by a user. Natural Language Processing (NLP) affords finer-grained access to more precise information contained in texts, which opens up a range of data analysis and knowledge synthesis functionalities. Powerful tools have been designed to exploit these techniques for the benefit of biomedical researchers, extracting millions of facts from the published literature and assisting Literature-Based Discovery. This chapter is organized as follows. It first describes the current capacities of IR from the Medline® bibliographic database. A short introduction to the main concepts of Natural Language Processing follows. Tasks which build on Natural Language Processing are then presented: Information Extraction and its derivatives and Literature-Based Discovery. A review of some existing applications closes the chapter. The references cited in the text are supplemented by a list of textbooks and Web resources.}},

Ontologies have been extensively utilized in the biomedical domain either as controlled vocabularies or to provide the framework for mapping relations between concepts in biology and medicine. Literature-based approaches and ontologies have been used in the past for the purpose of hypothesis generation in connection with drug discovery. Here, we review the application of literature mining and ontology modeling and traversal to the area of drug repurposing (DR). In recent years, DR has emerged as a noteworthy alternative to the traditional drug development process, in response to the decreased productivity of the biopharmaceutical industry. Thus, systematic approaches to DR have been developed, involving a variety of in silico, genomic and high-throughput screening technologies. Attempts to integrate literature mining with other types of data arising from the use of these technologies as well as visualization tools assisting in the discovery of novel associations between existing drugs and new indications will also be presented.}},

    abstract = {{Sophisticated information technologies are needed for effective data acquisition and integration from a growing body of the biomedical literature. Successful term identification is key to getting access to the stored literature information, as it is the terms (and their relationships) that convey knowledge across scientific articles. Due to the complexities of a dynamically changing biomedical terminology, term identification has been recognized as the current bottleneck in text mining, and—as a consequence—has become an important research topic both in natural language processing and biomedical communities. This article overviews state-of-the-art approaches in term identification. The process of identifying terms is analysed through three steps: term recognition, term classification, and term mapping. For each step, main approaches and general trends, along with the major problems, are discussed. By assessing previous work in context of the overall term identification process, the review also tries to delineate needs for future work in the field.}},

@article{Neves2012Survey,
    abstract = {{New approaches to biomedical text mining crucially depend on the existence of comprehensive annotated corpora. Such corpora, commonly called gold standards, are important for learning patterns or models during the training phase, for evaluating and comparing the performance of algorithms and also for better understanding the information sought for by means of examples. Gold standards depend on human understanding and manual annotation of natural language text. This process is very time-consuming and expensive because it requires high intellectual effort from domain experts. Accordingly, the lack of gold standards is considered as one of the main bottlenecks for developing novel text mining methods. This situation led the development of tools that support humans in annotating texts. Such tools should be intuitive to use, should support a range of different input formats, should include visualization of annotated texts and should generate an easy-to-parse output format. Today, a range of tools which implement some of these functionalities are available. In this survey, we present a comprehensive survey of tools for supporting annotation of biomedical texts. Altogether, we considered almost 30 tools, 13 of which were selected for an in-depth comparison. The comparison was performed using predefined criteria and was accompanied by hands-on experiences whenever possible. Our survey shows that current tools can support many of the tasks in biomedical text annotation in a satisfying manner, but also that no tool can be considered as a true comprehensive solution.}},

                For the average biologist, hands-on literature mining currently means a keyword search in PubMed. However, methods for extracting biomedical facts from the scientific literature have improved considerably, and the associated tools will probably soon be used in many laboratories to automatically annotate and analyse the growing number of system-wide experimental data sets. Owing to the increasing body of text and the open-access policies of many journals, literature mining is also becoming useful for both hypothesis generation and biological discovery. However, the latter will require the integration of literature and high-throughput data, which should encourage close collaborations between biologists and computational linguists.

                The paper presents an interactive discovery support system for the field of medicine. The intended users of the system are medical researchers. The goal of the system is: for a given starting concept of interest, discover new, potentially meaningful relations with other concepts that have not been published in the medical literature before. The known relations between the medical concepts come from the Medline bibliographic database and the UMLS. We use association rules for discovering the relationship between medical concepts. We evaluated the system by testing how successfully it predicted future discoveries (new relations between concepts). We first divided the Medline database into two segments (older and newer) using the publication date. Then we calculated how many of the new relations found by the system in the older segment become known relations in the newer segment. We found out with statistical significance that the system predicts new relations better then someone predicting randomly. The evaluation showed that our approach for supporting discovery in medicine is successful, but also that some improvements are needed, especially on limiting the number of potential discoveries the system generates.

While researchers formulate new hypotheses to test, it is very important for them to identify connections to their work from other parts of the literature. However, the current volume of information has become a great barrier for this task and new automated tools are needed to help researchers identify new knowledge that bridges gaps across distinct sections of the literature. In this paper, we present a literature-based discovery system called LitLinker that incorporates knowledge-based methodologies with a statistical method to mine the biomedical literature for new, potentially causal connections between biomedical terms.

                Within the peer-reviewed literature, associations between two things are not always recognized until commonalities between them become apparent. These commonalities can provide justification for the inference of a new relationship where none was previously known, and are the basis of most observation-based hypothesis formation. It has been shown that the crux of the problem is not finding inferable associations, which are extraordinarily abundant given the scale-free networks that arise from literature-based associations, but determining which ones are informative. The Mutual Information Measure (MIM) is a well-established method to measure how informative an association is, but is limited to direct (i.e. observable) associations.
                Herein, we attempt to extend the calculation of mutual information to indirect (i.e. inferable) associations by using the MIM of shared associations. Objects of general research interest (e.g. genes, diseases, phenotypes, drugs, ontology categories) found within MEDLINE are used to create a network of associations for evaluation.
                Mutual information calculations can be effectively extended into implied relationships and a significance cutoff estimated from analysis of random word networks. Of the models tested, the shared minimum MIM (MMIM) model is found to correlate best with the observed strength and frequency of known associations. Using three test cases, the MMIM method tends to rank more specific relationships higher than counting the number of shared relationships within a network.

                New relationships are often implicit from existing information, but the amount and growth of published literature limits the scope of analysis an individual can accomplish. Our goal was to develop and test a computational method to identify relationships within scientific reports, such that large sets of relationships between unrelated items could be sought out and statistically ranked for their potential relevance as a set.
                We first construct a network of tentative relationships between 'objects' of biomedical research interest (e.g. genes, diseases, phenotypes, chemicals) by identifying their co-occurrences within all electronically available MEDLINE records. Relationships shared by two unrelated objects are then ranked against a random network model to estimate the statistical significance of any given grouping. When compared against known relationships, we find that this ranking correlates with both the probability and frequency of object co-occurrence, demonstrating the method is well suited to discover novel relationships based upon existing shared relationships. To test this, we identified compounds whose shared relationships predicted they might affect the development and/or progression of cardiac hypertrophy. When laboratory tests were performed in a rodent model, chlorpromazine was found to reduce the progression of cardiac hypertrophy.

    abstract = {{In this paper we utilize methods of hyperdimensional computing to mediate the identification of therapeutically useful connections for the purpose of literature-based discovery. Our approach, named Predication-based Semantic Indexing, is utilized to identify empirically sequences of relationships known as  ” discovery patterns”, such as  ” drug x INHIBITS substance y, substance y CAUSES disease z” that link pharmaceutical substances to diseases they are known to treat. These sequences are derived from semantic predications extracted from the biomedical literature by the SemRep system, and subsequently utilized to direct the search for known treatments for a held out set of diseases. Rapid and efficient inference is accomplished through the application of geometric operators in PSI space, allowing for both the derivation of discovery patterns from a large set of known TREATS relationships, and the application of these discovered patterns to constrain search for therapeutic relationships at scale. Our results include the rediscovery of discovery patterns that have been constructed manually by other authors in previous research, as well as the discovery of a set of previously unrecognized patterns. The application of these patterns to direct search through PSI space results in better recovery of therapeutic relationships than is accomplished with models based on distributional statistics alone. These results demonstrate the utility of efficient approximate inference in geometric space as a means to identify therapeutic relationships, suggesting a role of these methods in drug repurposing efforts. In addition, the results provide strong support for the utility of the discovery pattern approach pioneered by Hristovski and his colleagues. PSI represents concepts and relations in hyperdimensional space. PSI is used to infer discovery patterns from known therapeutic relationships. These patterns are used to recover therapeutic relationships for a held-out disease set.PSI outperforms a co-occurrence based approach in this regard. PSI searches efficiently across large networks of relevant relationships..}},

    abstract = {{This paper addresses the issue of analogical inference, and its potential role as the mediator of new therapeutic discoveries, by using disjunction operators based on quantum connectives to combine many potential reasoning pathways into a single search expression. In it, we extend our previous work in which we developed an approach to analogical retrieval using the Predication-based Semantic Indexing (PSI) model, which encodes both concepts and the relationships between them in high-dimensional vector space. As in our previous work, we leverage the ability of PSI to infer predicate pathways connecting two example concepts, in this case comprising of known therapeutic relationships. For example, given that drug x TREATS disease z, we might infer the predicate pathway drug x INTERACTS\_WITH gene y ASSOCIATED\_WITH disease z, and use this pathway to search for drugs related to another disease in similar ways. As biological systems tend to be characterized by networks of relationships, we evaluate the ability of quantum-inspired operators to mediate inference and retrieval across multiple relations, by testing the ability of different approaches to recover known therapeutic relationships. In addition, we introduce a novel complex vector based implementation of PSI, based on Plate's Circular Holographic Reduced Representations, which we utilize for all experiments in addition to the binary vector based approach we have applied in our previous research.}},

Yet, much as their needs for hard and soft infrastructure, effective business practices, and an educated workforce parallel similar needs that underlay earlier development in the West, replicating Western development would overlook the hallmarks of the current century: widely available information and communications technology; a set of electronic linkages among the world; and a global business environment, to name just a few. Consequently, it should be possible to allow developing countries to use  ” leapfrog” technologies that were inconceivable decades ago to support their development. One means of identifying these opportunities is by matching traditional development needs with novel support by connecting previously unrelated literatures.
                            Equally interesting, the poor in many regions are compelled to seek innovative solutions that extend their resources and otherwise make their lives easier. These can include truly surprising hybrids (like washing machine – bicycles) that serve distinct local needs. Yet, these innovations have the potential to be of great value in West, either through direct commercialization or serving as a source of inspiration. These developing world innovations, too, can be linked to currently unrecognized needs or opportunities in the West by proper cross-fertilization.

     abstract = {Knowledge can be public, yet undiscovered, if independently created fragments are logically related but never retrieved, brought together, and interpreted. Information retrieval, although essential for assembling such fragments, is always problematic. The search process, like a scientific theory, can be criticized and improved, but can never be verified as capable of retrieving all information relevant to a problem or theory. This essential incompleteness of search and retrieval therefore makes possible, and plausible, the existence of undiscovered public knowledge. Three examples intended to throw light on the logic of undiscovered knowledge are constructed and analyzed. The argument is developed within the framework of a Popperian or critical approach within science and on Popper's distinction between subjective and objective knowledge--the distinction between World 2 and World 3.},

                While medical researchers formulate new hypotheses to test, they need to identify connections to their work from other parts of the medical literature. However, the current volume of information has become a great barrier for this task. Recently, many literature-based discovery (LBD) systems have been developed to help researchers identify new knowledge that bridges gaps across distinct sections of the medical literature. Each LBD system uses different methods for mining the connections from text and ranking the identified connections, but none of the currently available LBD evaluation approaches can be used to compare the effectiveness of these methods. In this paper, we present an evaluation methodology for LBD systems that allows comparisons across different systems. We demonstrate the abilities of our evaluation methodology by using it to compare the performance of different correlation-mining and ranking approaches used by existing LBD systems. This evaluation methodology should help other researchers compare approaches, make informed algorithm choices, and ultimately help to improve the performance of LBD systems overall.

@article{rin03,
    abstract = {{Interpretation of semantic propositions in free-text documents such as MEDLINE citations would provide valuable support for biomedical applications, and several approaches to semantic interpretation are being pursued in the biomedical informatics community. In this paper, we describe a methodology for interpreting linguistic structures that encode hypernymic propositions, in which a more specific concept is in a taxonomic relationship with a more general concept. In order to effectively process these constructions, we exploit underspecified syntactic analysis and structured domain knowledge from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). After introducing the syntactic processing on which our system depends, we focus on the UMLS knowledge that supports interpretation of hypernymic propositions. We first use semantic groups from the Semantic Network to ensure that the two concepts involved are compatible; hierarchical information in the Metathesaurus then determines which concept is more general and which more specific. A preliminary evaluation of a sample based on the semantic group Chemicals and Drugs provides 83\% precision. An error analysis was conducted and potential solutions to the problems encountered are presented. The research discussed here serves as a paradigm for investigating the interaction between domain knowledge and linguistic structure in natural language processing, and could also make a contribution to research on automatic processing of discourse structure. Additional implications of the system we present include its integration in advanced semantic interpretation processors for biomedical text and its use for information extraction in specific domains. The approach has the potential to support a range of applications, including information retrieval and ontology engineering.}},

Such features include the detection of author-defined acronyms/abbreviations, the ability to browse the Metathesaurus for concepts even tenuously related to input text, the detection of negation in situations in which the polarity of predications is important, word sense disambiguation (WSD), and various technical and algorithmic features. Near-term plans for MetaMap development include the incorporation of chemical name recognition and enhanced WSD.

                We present an extension to literature-based discovery that goes beyond making discoveries to a principled way of navigating through selected aspects of some biomedical domain. The method is a type of "discovery browsing" that guides the user through the research literature on a specified phenomenon. Poorly understood relationships may be explored through novel points of view, and potentially interesting relationships need not be known ahead of time. In a process of "cooperative reciprocity" the user iteratively focuses system output, thus controlling the large number of relationships often generated in literature-based discovery systems. The underlying technology exploits SemRep semantic predications represented as a graph of interconnected nodes (predication arguments) and edges (predicates). The system suggests paths in this graph, which represent chains of relationships. The methodology is illustrated with depressive disorder and focuses on the interaction of inflammation, circadian phenomena, and the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. Insight provided may contribute to enhanced understanding of the pathophysiology, treatment, and prevention of this disorder.

Since there is no comprehensive \^{a}gold standard, \^{a} or consistent formal evaluation methodology for LBD systems, the development and usage of effective metrics for such systems is also discussed, providing several options.

                The Arrowsmith two-node search is a strategy that is designed to assist biomedical investigators in formulating and assessing scientific hypotheses. More generally, it allows users to identify biologically meaningful links between any two sets of articles A and C in PubMed, even when these share no articles or authors in common and represent disparate topics or disciplines. The key idea is to relate the two sets of articles via title words and phrases (B-terms) that they share. We have created a free, public web-based version of the two-node search tool (http://arrowsmith.psych.uic.edu), have described its development and implementation, and have presented analyses of individual two-node searches. In this paper, we provide an updated tutorial intended for end-users, that covers the use of the tool for a variety of potential scientific use case scenarios. For example, one can assess a recent experimental, clinical or epidemiologic finding that connects two disparate fields of inquiry--identifying likely mechanisms to explain the finding, and choosing promising follow-up lines of investigation. Alternatively, one can assess whether the existing scientific literature lends indirect support to a hypothesis posed by the user that has not yet been investigated. One can also employ two-node searches to search for novel hypotheses. Arrowsmith provides a service that cannot be carried out feasibly via standard PubMed searches or by other available text mining tools.

RESULTS: We analyzed a set of 3902 biomedical full-text articles. Different keyword measures indicate that information density is highest in abstracts, but that the information coverage in full texts is much greater than in abstracts. Analysis of five different standard sections of articles shows that the highest information coverage is located in the results section. Still, 30-40\% of the information mentioned in each section is unique to that section. Only 30\% of the gene symbols in the abstract are accompanied by their corresponding names, and a further 8\% of the gene names are found in the full text. In the full text, only 18\% of the gene symbols are accompanied by their gene names.}},

@book{Weiss2012Fundamentals,
    abstract = {One consequence of the pervasive use of computers is that most documents originate in digital form. Widespread use of the Internet makes them readily available. Text mining the process of analyzing unstructured natural-language text is concerned with how to extract information from these documents. Developed from the authors highly successful Springer reference on text mining, Fundamentals of Predictive Text Mining is an introductory textbook and guide to this rapidly evolving field. Integrating topics spanning the varied disciplines of data mining, machine learning, databases, and computational linguistics, this uniquely useful book also provides practical advice for text mining. In-depth discussions are presented on issues of document classification, information retrieval, clustering and organizing documents, information extraction, web-based data-sourcing, and prediction and evaluation. Background on data mining is beneficial, but not essential. Where advanced concepts are discussed that require mathematical maturity for a proper understanding, intuitive explanations are also provided for less advanced readers. Topics and features: presents a comprehensive, practical and easy-to-read introduction to text mining; includes chapter summaries, useful historical and bibliographic remarks, and classroom-tested exercises for each chapter; explores the application and utility of each method, as well as the optimum techniques for specific scenarios; provides several descriptive case studies that take readers from problem description to systems deployment in the real world; includes access to industrial-strength text-mining software that runs on any computer; describes methods that rely on basic statistical techniques, thus allowing for relevance to all languages (not just English); contains links to free downloadable software and other supplementary instruction material. Fundamentals of Predictive Text Mining is an essential resource for {IT} professionals and managers, as well as a key text for advanced undergraduate computer science students and beginning graduate students.

    abstract = {
                Scientific progress is increasingly based on knowledge and information. Knowledge is now recognized as the driver of productivity and economic growth, leading to a new focus on the role of information in the decision-making process. Most scientific knowledge is registered in publications and other unstructured representations that make it difficult to use and to integrate the information with other sources (e.g. biological databases). Making a computer understand human language has proven to be a complex achievement, but there are techniques capable of detecting, distinguishing and extracting a limited number of different classes of facts. In the biomedical field, extracting information has specific problems: complex and ever-changing nomenclature (especially genes and proteins) and the limited representation of domain knowledge.

@article{Tamames2010EnvMine,
    abstract = {For ecological studies, it is crucial to count on adequate descriptions of the environments and samples being studied. Such a description must be done in terms of their physicochemical characteristics, allowing a direct comparison between different environments that would be difficult to do otherwise. Also the characterization must include the precise geographical location, to make possible the study of geographical distributions and biogeographical patterns. Currently, there is no schema for annotating these environmental features, and these data have to be extracted from textual sources (published articles). So far, this had to be performed by manual inspection of the corresponding documents. To facilitate this task, we have developed {EnvMine}, a set of text-mining tools devoted to retrieve contextual information (physicochemical variables and geographical locations) from textual sources of any kind. {EnvMine} is capable of retrieving the physicochemical variables cited in the text, by means of the accurate identification of their associated units of measurement. In this task, the system achieves a recall (percentage of items retrieved) of 92\% with less than 1\% error. Also a Bayesian classifier was tested for distinguishing parts of the text describing environmental characteristics from others dealing with, for instance, experimental {settings.Regarding} the identification of geographical locations, the system takes advantage of existing databases such as {GeoNames} to achieve 86\% recall with 92\% precision. The identification of a location includes also the determination of its exact coordinates (latitude and longitude), thus allowing the calculation of distance between the individual locations. {EnvMine} is a very efficient method for extracting contextual information from different text sources, like published articles or web pages. This tool can help in determining the precise location and physicochemical variables of sampling sites, thus facilitating the performance of ecological analyses. {EnvMine} can also help in the development of standards for the annotation of environmental features.},

@article{Pafilis2013SPECIES,
    abstract = {The exponential growth of the biomedical literature is making the need for efficient, accurate text-mining tools increasingly clear. The identification of named biological entities in text is a central and difficult task. We have developed an efficient algorithm and implementation of a dictionary-based approach to named entity recognition, which we here use to identify names of species and other taxa in text. The tool, {SPECIES}, is more than an order of magnitude faster and as accurate as existing tools. The precision and recall was assessed both on an existing gold-standard corpus and on a new corpus of 800 abstracts, which were manually annotated after the development of the tool. The corpus comprises abstracts from journals selected to represent many taxonomic groups, which gives insights into which types of organism names are hard to detect and which are easy. Finally, we have tagged organism names in the entire Medline database and developed a web resource, {ORGANISMS}, that makes the results accessible to the broad community of biologists. The {SPECIES} software is open source and can be downloaded from http://species.jensenlab.org along with dictionary files and the manually annotated gold-standard corpus. The {ORGANISMS} web resource can be found at http://organisms.jensenlab.org.},

When compared against our manually annotated corpus, {LINNAEUS} performs with 94\% recall and 97\% precision at the mention level, and 98\% recall and 90\% precision at the document level. Our system successfully solves the problem of disambiguating uncertain species mentions, with 97\% of all mentions in {PubMed} Central full-text documents resolved to unambiguous {NCBI} taxonomy {identifiers.CONCLUSIONS}:{LINNAEUS} is an open source, stand-alone software system capable of recognizing and normalizing species name mentions with speed and accuracy, and can therefore be integrated into a range of bioinformatics and text-mining applications.

Here we illustrate the scale of the problems with species names, synonyms, and their classification, and describe how {WoRMS} publishes online quality assured information on marine species. Within {WoRMS}, over 100 global, 12 regional and 4 thematic species databases are integrated with a common taxonomy. Over 240 editors from 133 institutions and 31 countries manage the content. To avoid duplication of effort, content is exchanged with 10 external databases. At present {WoRMS} contains 460,000 taxonomic names (from Kingdom to subspecies), 368,000 species level combinations of which 215,000 are currently accepted marine species names, and 26,000 related but non-marine species. Associated information includes 150,000 literature sources, 20,000 images, and locations of 44,000 specimens. Usage has grown linearly since its launch in 2007, with about 600,000 unique visitors to the website in 2011, and at least 90 organisations from 12 countries using {WoRMS} for their data management. By providing easy access to expert-validated content, {WoRMS} improves quality control in the use of species names, with consequent benefits to taxonomy, ecology, conservation and marine biodiversity research and management. The service manages information on species names that would otherwise be overly costly for individuals, and thus minimises errors in the application of nomenclature standards. {WoRMS}' content is expanding to include host-parasite relationships, additional literature sources, locations of specimens, images, distribution range, ecological, and biological data. Species are being categorised as introduced (alien, invasive), of conservation importance, and on other attributes. These developments have a multiplier effect on its potential as a resource for biodiversity research and management. As a consequence of {WoRMS}, we are witnessing improved communication within the scientific community, and anticipate increased taxonomic efficiency and quality control in marine biodiversity research and management.},

This requires solving a host of classical data management challenges including data acquisition (e.g., from scanned documents), data extraction, and data integration. {SIGMOD} attendees will see demonstrations of three aspects of our system: (1) an end-to-end system that is of a high enough quality to perform novel geological science, but is written by a small enough team so that each aspect can be manageably explained; (2) a simple feature engineering system that allows a user to write in familiar {SQL} or Python; and (3) the effect of different sources of feedback on result quality including expert labeling, distant supervision, traditional rules, and crowd-sourced data. Our prototype builds on our work integrating statistical inference and learning tools into traditional database systems. If successful, our demonstration will allow attendees to see that data processing systems that use machine learning contain many familiar data processing problems such as efficient querying, indexing, and supporting tools for database-backed websites, none of which are machine-learning problems, per se.},

    abstract = {In this paper, we describe an innovative application of mining laws to identify and measure overlapping jurisdictions of government agencies. Laws (statutes and regulations) were used to represent ocean and coastal management for four geopolitical jurisdictions of federal and state levels (Washington, Oregon, and California). We developed preliminary metrics of overlap based on the number of statutes, regulations, and agencies associated with any given topic. The utility of these metrics was tested on 46 topics representing a range of activities and resources across ocean-related sectors within the geographic scope of laws investigated. We found the preliminary results of the overlaps metrics to reveal results similar to a recent review of federal ocean management. In addition, a network diagram graphical display of the data revealed multiple dimensions to facilitate interpretation of results.},
